# Occupancy rate
This project will analyze the Airbnb listings and identify critical features that mostly affect the occupancy rate of a listing. 
The result of the analysis will help hosts in optimizing their listings and will increase the occupancy rates. 
Optimizing listings will eventually improve both hosts and guests experiences and yield higher retention.

The occupancy rates for each listing is estimated as a function of the average number of reviews per month and minimum required nights. The distibution of occupancy rates is as follows:
